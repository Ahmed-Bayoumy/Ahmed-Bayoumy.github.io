      <div><p>Dr. Bayoumy is a software engineer at Siemens Digital Industries Software. He is responsible for developing innovative strategies and software solutions related to multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) of complex engineering systems. Before joining Siemens, Dr. Bayoumy was first a PhD student and then a postdoctoral researcher at the Systems Optimization Laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of McGill University. His research was co-funded by the Canadian National Science and Engineering Research Council and Siemens Energy, which enabled him to implement and use his relative adequacy framework on aero-derivative gas turbine MDO problems.</p></div>

      <li>(2016-2019) MECH 559, 501, 502: Engineering Systems Optimization, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
        <p> I have worked as a teaching assistant and occasionally substitute lecturer for these courses. My lectures focused on multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) architectures and their implementation to solve realistic MDO problems. I demonstrated the importance of considering multidisciplinary interactions to leverage system performance by means of running examples. Nonetheless, solving a fully-coupled MDO problem using the multidisciplinary feasible architecture (MDF) is an intricate process. Typically, MDF approaches do not converge, within a reasonable computational budget, when they are used to solve a fully-coupled MDO problem all at once. That's why interdisciplinary feasible architectures (IDF) are honored to solve fully-coupled MDO problems at any design level. I showed the students how to decompose the fully-coupled MDO problem into subproblems and how to use and implement the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as a coordinator to ensure the consistency of design solutions obtained by the partitioned subproblems. </p> </li>
        <li>(2016, 2018) MECH 292: Conceptual Design, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
          <p> I have worked as a teaching assistant for that course. I was responsible on introducing and demonstrating engineering design concepts and how to formulate design problems, generate ideas, and conduct a feasibility study. I also introduced the principles of preliminary design, design, analysis, design evaluation, project management, and optimal design to students. I helped them complete and present their design projects required by that course.</p>

        <li>(2017-2019) MECH 290: Design Graphics for Mechanical Engineering using SolidWorks, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
      <p>I demonstrated the utilization of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) in the design process at different design levels, including free-hand sketching; from geometry construction to manufacturing drawings; the technology and standards of engineering graphic communication; designing with CAD software. The role of visualization in the production of mechanical engineering designs. I also demonstrated how the key-features of SolidWorks facilitates achieving the aforementioned objectives. </p>

      <li>(2016) MECH 539: Computational Aerodynamics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
