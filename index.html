          Dr. Bayoumy is a researcher and software engineer at Siemens Digital Industries Software. He is responsible for developing innovative strategies and software solutions for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) of complex engineering systems, AI, and autoML. Before joining Siemens, Dr. Bayoumy was a PhD student and then a postdoctoral researcher at the Systems Optimization Laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGill University. His research was co-funded by the Canadian National Science and Engineering Research Council and Siemens Energy, which enabled him to use his systems engineering MDO and AI expertise to implement his novel relative adequacy framework on aero-derivative gas turbine MDO problems.

        <li>(2016-2019) MECH 559, 501, 502: Engineering Systems Optimization, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
          <p> I have worked as a teaching assistant and occasionally substitute lecturer for these courses. My lectures focused on multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) architectures and their implementation to solve realistic MDO problems. I demonstrated the importance of considering multidisciplinary interactions to leverage system performance by means of running examples. Nonetheless, solving a fully-coupled MDO problem using the multidisciplinary feasible architecture (MDF) is an intricate process. Typically, MDF approaches do not converge, within a reasonable computational budget, when they are used to solve a fully-coupled MDO problem all at once. That's why interdisciplinary feasible architectures (IDF) are honored to solve fully-coupled MDO problems at any design level. I showed the students how to decompose the fully-coupled MDO problem into subproblems and how to use and implement the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as a coordinator to ensure the consistency of design solutions obtained by the partitioned subproblems. </p> </li>

        <p><strong>Research Interests</strong></p>
          Since design space exploration and optimization reinforce, not replace, the designer’s decision-making process, their utilization needs to be efficient and beneficial. Managing the fidelity requirements of the disciplines involved in the multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) processes is crucial to exploring and assessing different designs within reasonable time frames. I can build on my recent work that utilizes relative errors among available models regardless of their expected fidelity to enhance the predictive capability of inexpensive models and reduce the use of expensive ones. 
          My expertise in multidisciplinary design optimization provides me with a solid foundation in various domains with different disciplinary structures.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Research Accomplishments</strong></p>
        <p>
          My previous research aimed to address how to manage the use of models in numerical design optimization. My thesis work helped to answer this question by developing a novel relative adequacy framework (RAF) for managing the use of multiple models during design exploration. The framework was implemented by means of a set of algorithms for solving single- and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems and is distinguished by the following features:
          <ul style="font-size: 14px">
          <li>It utilizes a rigorous direct search optimization algorithm that does not require gradients or their approximation. </li>
          <li>It manages the use of multiple models regardless of their expected fidelity or their disciplinary context by estimating errors and utilizing trust-region principles.</li>
          <li>It enables optimization of engineering problems that require expensive computations typically performed by so-called blackboxes.</li>
          <li>It applies for a broad class of time-invariant and time-dependent multidisciplinary design optimization problems.</li>
          </ul>
          I also had the opportunity to work on a National Science and Engineering Research Canada (NSERC) project as a Collaborative Research and Development (CRD) Research Assistant. This project involves Siemens-Energy, McGill and ETS. The project's goal is to build a digital platform for models and data management with an integrated suite of analysis, design, and optimization tools. My contributions to this project involve:
          <ul style="font-size: 14px">
          <li>Developing python codes for running MDO problems using a penalty-based distributed interdisciplinary feasible (IDF) formulation known as non-hierarchical analytical target cascading (NHATC) which uses the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. </li>
          <li>Utilizing the developed code to automate/accelerate the convergence of the feedback coupling between the gas turbine performance analysis and secondary air system analysis (engine bleeds flow analysis).</li>
